# hogsia
A data visualization of hog confinement buildings in the state of Iowa. 

hogsia aims to let viewers see proximity of hog confinement buliding near there homes, provide statistics on swine production, and data overlays.

### Data
The data set https://programs.iowadnr.gov/nrgislibx/ located on the Iowa DNR Natural Resources Geographic Information Systems Library is in .dbf format,
an old outdatad database platform. I saved the database as a .csv and imported in a mysqlite3 database for efficiency and streamlined capability.
